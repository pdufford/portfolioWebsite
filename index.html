			Hello! I'm Presten, an aspiring I.T. student and employee at Olympic College.
			
			I have currently been a student at Olympic College for four years now, having started in Fall of 2015 after graduating high school. I obtained my Associates of Applied Science in Web Developoment in Spring of 2018. I had orginially started on the programming pathway after enjoying Programming Concepts, but would later realize that it was not the kind of career I was looking for. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			After retooling myself and obtaining my AAS, I attended another year of classes focusing on I.T. support, network administration, and project management, having completed four of the relavant certificates at OC. Now, I'm a student in the Bachelors of Applied Science in Information Systems program.

				Personal Interests and Goals
			</h2>
			<p>
				Beyond work and school, I tend to spend my time playing guitar and video games. Recently moved to PC gaming, and have been enjoying more casual games as of late. Most of my wishlist are platformers coming soon, so that's something I'm looking forward to. I've been playing guitar for around a decade now, mostly on accoustic but I do have a few electrics I try to dust off!
				<br />
				<br />
				Being a student and employee at Olympic College has been a great way to learn and get relvant job experience at the same time, and for that I'm very grateful. Beyond college, I'm looking to become involved in the technical/support fields in the I.T. sector, and potentially move into administration later in life. On the side, I've considered small-time web design/development, but that would be later in life as well. I'm excited for what the future has in store for me!
